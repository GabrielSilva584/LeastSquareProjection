This is an implementation of the LSP (Least Square Projection) algorithm, proposed by Paulovich et al.[1]. Since the main goal of this implementation is the data visualization, we only project the point to 2D.

This was made in the R language and be used with any visualization library you prefer. Below you can find a brief description of the function and how it is supposed to be used.

Requirements: 

The function depends on the libraries 'MASS', 'FNN' e 'kmed'.

Function: lsp

The lsp function recieves a data.frame with more than 2 columns of data and returns the projected points in a two-dimensional space.

Arguments: 

-> data: data.frame containing the multidimensional data you want to project.

Return:

-> X: list containing the projets points(X$points) and the control points used	(X$medoids).


Script usage:

-> Command line format: Rscript LSP.r ["in.csv" ["out.pdf"]]
   [] -> optional
   
Arguments:

-> "in.csv": input file containing the desired data.frame
-> "out.pdf": output file for graphical results (default value: "plot.pdf")

If no arguments are present, the script will use two sample data.frames ("mtcars" and "iris")
